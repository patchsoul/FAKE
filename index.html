<details><summary># Terminal Commands</summary>
    # This terminal has super awesome features, with multi-line code areas possible.
    # Navigate history with up and down arrows.
    # Press enter to execute, and shift-enter to create a newline in the current code area.
    # You can swap this behavior by clicking on the [Enter to execute] button above.

</details><details><summary># Numbers and Basic Math: +- */ ^_</summary>
    #       # a hash symbol means ignore the remaining input to end-of-line, i.e. make a comment.
    0.5     # push a number to the stack.  a number begins with 0-9, so start with 0. to do fractions.
    -5.3    # push a negative number to the stack, i.e. - is unary minus if 0-9 follows.
    +-*/    # standard mathematical operators, postfix notation, operating on numbers already on the stack.
    ^       # power, takes NOS as base and TOS as exponent.
    _       # natural log, determines ln of TOS.
            #   to take an arbitrary log, base B, of some number N:
            #       N_B_/   # infix: log_B(N) = log(N)/log(B)

    # examples

    0.5 2 - # result is -1.5
    8.5 2 * # result is 17
    5 3 ^   # result is 125
    42_     # result is 3.737...

</details><details><summary># Stack Operators: e dyYp ~ n</summary>
    # TOS is "top of stack", and NOS is "next on stack."

    e   # identity operator, used for keeping track of stack index when printing the stack.
        #   executes next instruction as is.
        #   CANNOT be used to do scientific notation.
    d   # duplicate: deep copy of TOS.
    y   # copy: shallow copy TOS.  numbers and strings get deep copied.
    Y   # double copy: shallow copy NOS and TOS, to same relative positions.
    p   # pop the TOS, i.e., remove it from the stack.
    ~   # swap the TOS and NOS.
    n   # push number of elements to stack.

    # examples

    5 4Y    # yields 5 4 5 e4
    6n      # if nothing else in the stack, yields 6 e1
    5d*     # yields 25, duplicates 5 and multiplies together.
    5y*     # same as 5d*
    1 2 3~  # yields 1 3 e2

</details><details><summary># Statements via Various Parentheses: () [] {}</summary>
    # All parentheses [] {} () create a statement based on the functions inside;
    #   A statement acts like a single instruction, but can be composed of multiple instructions.
    #   The statements () {} and () differ in their behavior, though.

    []  # create a normal statement, which acts as one instruction.
    {}  # create a new stack; any internal instructions push elements to this stack.
        #   the new stack appears on the old stack as an array element.
    ()  # this statement lowers the stack index without popping the original TOS.  (NOS becomes TOS.)
        #   instructions inside the () will act on the original NOS as if it was the TOS.
        #   while the stack index is lowered, 
        #       any elements which get pushed to the stack get inserted into the stack,
        #       and the original TOS gets moved up further.
        #   the original TOS will reappear at the end of the () statement.
    
    # examples
    {1 2 3} # pushes the array {1 2 3} to the stack.
    [45.5 33.3]  # yields 45.5 e33.3 
    1 5d(+) # yields 6 e5

</details><details><summary># Strings, Print Strings, and Execution Strings: '' "" ``</summary>
    ''  # push a string to the stack.
    ""  # print string to output.
    ``  # execute the enclosed instruction.
        # this is useful for multi-character instructions, e.g. `function`.  (see "Function definitions".)
        # `` can also be nested inside a '' or "" string, which executes the instruction inside
        #   and then pops the TOS to write to that point in the string.  YAY for arbitrary code execution!

    # examples
    
    "hello world!"      # this is the hello world program.
    'this is a string'  # pushed to stack.
    3'what is the TOS?  it is `y`.'
                        # `y` executes and duplicates what is on the stack (3), which gets popped and written into the string.

</details><details><summary># Context-dependent Printing: ,;</summary>
    # The comma and semi-colon are useful for printing the TOS to output,
    # though in some circumstances (e.g. check out Matrix Definition) they will do different things.

    ,   # print TOS and pop it, but don't use a newline after printing.  (use a space.)
    ;   # print TOS and pop it, appending a newline to the output.

    # examples

    'hello!';   # prints 'hello!' to output.  could also be done with "hello!" (see Print Strings).
    1,2,3,4,5;  # prints "1 2 3 4 5" to output (newline after 5).

</details><details><summary># Comparisons, Logic, and Conditional Branching: <=> ?&| !</summary>
    <   # push NOS < TOS (result is 0 or 1), after popping both.
    >   # push NOS > TOS (result is 0 or 1), after popping both.
    =   # check if NOS is equal to TOS (result is 0 or 1), after popping both.

    ?   # push logical value of TOS (either 1 or 0), based on value of TOS.
    &   # push logical value (0 or 1) of NOS logical-AND TOS, after popping both.
    |   # push logical value (0 or 1) of NOS logical-OR TOS, after popping both.

    !   # NOT conditional: branch based on logical value of TOS, and pop it.
        #   execute first subsequent instruction if TOS was logically zero,
        #   otherwise execute the second instruction.

    # examples

    5 3 <   # result is e0
    4 4 =   # result is e1
    5 5 >   # result is e0
    6 0 >   # result is e1

    123?    # stack is 123 e1
    0?      # stack is 0 e0
    3 4&    # stack is e1
    0 3&    # result is e0
    3 0|    # result is e1
    0 0|    # result is e0

    0!["TOS was zero/null"100]["TOS was non-null"1000]
            # end stack result is e100
    3 4< !["got not branch (>=)"]["got yes branch (<)"]

</details><details><summary># Loop Operators: j k l</summary>
    # loops use the letters jkl, which are right in a row, and thus easy to remember!

    l   # loop statement; will loop over the next instruction if the jump operator is hit.
    j   # jump back to start of loop, or "continue", though this is required for a loop to repeat.
    k   # kill or quit loop, or "breaK", or kick out of loop prematurely.

    # examples

    10l[?!k"hello `y`!"1-j] # counts down from 10 to 1, leaves 0 on the stack.

</details><details><summary># Function definitions: abc zZ</summary>
    # Functions are defined with up to three subsequent instructions.

    abc # pop the TOS, use a string to define a function name.  abc are placeholders for instructions.
        #   the next instruction is interpreted as the function definition, which can use the placeholder instructions.
    z   # define a zero-instruction function, popping the TOS for a function name.
    Z   # define a variable zero-instruction function, popping TOS for a function name.
        #   i.e., the function can be changed later to something else.
    
    # examples
    
    'w'abl[a!kbj]   # create a while loop with two instructions (`ab`);
                    #   the first is executed to check whether to continue the loop, and if so, the second is executed
    1 2 3 4 5wn["hi `y`"p]
        # the first instruction is `n` (number of elements on stack), the second prints a string and pops the TOS

    'H'z0.5     # create a constant variable function (pushes 0.5 to stack)
    3H*         # yields e1.5
    'q'z[0.5^]  # create a square root function
    9q          # yields e3
    'inv'z[-1^] # create inverse function
    9`inv`      # yields e0.1111...
    'Q'Z0.25    # create variable zero-instruction function
    Q           # yields e0.25
    'Q'Z[4/]    # redefine Q to divide; requires something on TOS
    5Q          # yields e1.25

    # See also "Dictionary definitions" for some advanced function definition uses.

</details><details><summary># Dictionary definitions: aa bb cc</summary>
    # Dictionaries are simply functions with multiple instructions.
    # They have their own context for functions.

    # examples

    'A'aa                       # create a dictionary A, which is an identity operation.
    A['Z'z["hello arizona!"]]   # create a subdictionary Z, defined only inside the A context.
    AZ                          # call Z from within an A context, prints "hello arizona!"
    'B'Aaa                      # create subdictionary B
    'C'ABz["123"]               # create sub-sub-function C
    ABC                         # prints 123
    AB['E'z"four score and seven years ago"]
    ABE                         # prints iconic line.

    # It can get way more complicated than this, but these are the fundamentals.

</details><details><summary># Matrix Definitions: m ,;</summary>
    # You can build matrices using the `m` command.
    # `m` is a loop specification, so you can use the functions `j` and `k` to write the matrix.
    
    m   # take two arguments from the stack to get matrix dimensions (NOS for rows, TOS for columns), popping them,
        #   and execute next instruction to build the matrix.
    ,   # in the instruction after `m`, this pushes the TOS to the matrix.
    ;   # similarly, this pushes the TOS to the matrix, and fills the remainder of the row with zeroes.
    
    # examples

    2 2 m[1,0,0,1]  # build 2x2 identity matrix.
        # note that if the final instruction is to push a number to the stack, 
        # it will be pushed to the matrix.  (i.e., the final 1 did not need a subsequent comma.)
    2dm[1;0,1]      # equivalent; d duplicates the 2, so the matrix is 2x2.
    1 5m[1,2,3,4,5] # create a row vector
    0 3dm[1+d,j]    # creates a matrix using a loop; loop terminates once last element is written.

</details><details><summary># Array/Stack Definitions: {} SP Sp Se</summary>
    # You can build a new stack using squirrely braces: {'instructions go here'}
    # You can think of the new stack as a resizable array, with dynamically-typed elements inside.
    # The new stack will appear on your usual stack, and you can manipulate it with the following functions.

    S   # single-instruction dictionary for stack operations.
    Sp  # pop from the stack on the TOS, push it to the main stack.
    SP  # push the element on the TOS to the stack at the NOS.
    Se  # execute the next instruction using the stack on the TOS as the stack to manipulate.
        #   as a technical note, the \ context for Se is the root context, 
        #   so that p inside the statement works to pop an element from the stack, rather than executing Sp
    
    # example (run commands sequentially)

    {1 2 3 'hello'}     # pushes this new stack to the main stack.
    Sp  # result is {1 2 e3} e'hello'   # pops 'hello' from new stack.
    ' and goodbye!'+SP  # pushes 'hello and goodbye' onto the new stack.
    Se["My message for you is `y`" # execute these instructions within/for the new stack.
        l(n!k;j)   # loop through the elements below the string (using the parentheses ()), printing them
    ]   # return control the main stack
