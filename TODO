run commands on first pass, compile statements then run them...
well, no, since we want "reproducible" stack development.  if you can't parse it, no partial stack action
    maybe compromise:  execute code on newline (if not in the middle of a statement)

compiling a function:
    error if over-writing a function.
    figure out a way to make a variable function (everything right now is const)
