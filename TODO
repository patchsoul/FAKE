run commands on first pass, compile statements then run them...
well, no, since we want "reproducible" stack development.  if you can't parse it, no partial stack action

context:
    if you define some stuff:
    
    'A'aa
    A['B'aa]
    AB['C'z"123"]
    A['D'aa]
    AD['D'z+]
    AB['E'z[1\\DD\C]\DD]

defining an object:
    'A'aa
    'B'bb
    'C'cc
    # object size can grow, independent of what the initial size is.

defining a variable creator:
    'D'cc
    '+'Dzz@     # same as D['+'zz@]
    5.5'f'D+    # add variable f to scope D
    Df          # push variable f to stack

compiling a function:
    error if over-writing a function.
